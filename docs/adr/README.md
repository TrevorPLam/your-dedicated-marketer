# ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Last Updated: 2026-01-02

Use ADRs to prevent re-arguing the same architectural decisions with an AI model.

## When to write an ADR
Write an ADR when a choice affects:
- Architecture or module boundaries
- Persistence/data models/migrations
- Authentication/authorization
- API shape (public contracts)
- Deployment/runtime environment
- Security posture

## How
Copy `docs/adr/0001-template.md`, increment the number, and fill it in.
