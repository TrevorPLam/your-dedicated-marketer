## 💎 The Diamond Standard

This repository adheres to a strict "Diamond Standard" of engineering excellence, ensuring that every deployment is:

*   **Secure by Design**: CSP headers, strict input validation (Zod), and secret scanning.
*   **Edge Native**: Optimized for the Cloudflare Pages Edge Runtime.
*   **Type Safe**: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode enabled.
*   **Observable**: Integrated Sentry monitoring and comprehensive logging.
*   **AI-Ready**: Structured specifically for effective collaboration with AI coding agents (`AGENTS.md`, `READMEAI.md`).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Next.js App Router**: Utilizing the latest React Server Components architecture (version 15.5.9, compatible with Cloudflare Pages adapter).
*   **Content Engine**: MDX-powered blog and case studies with static generation.
*   **Client-Side Search**: Zero-latency, pre-indexed search functionality (`lib/search.ts`).
*   **Performance First**: 
    *   Tailwind CSS for zero-runtime styling.
    *   Automatic image optimization.
    *   Static Site Generation (SSG) for core pages.
*   **Developer Experience**:
    *   Vitest for unit testing.
    *   Playwright for E2E testing.
    *   ESLint (Flat Config) & Prettier for code quality.
    *   Dev Container support for consistent environments.
