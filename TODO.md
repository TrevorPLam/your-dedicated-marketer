## P1 - High (Reliability, Core UX, Maintainability)
### T-050: Align React DOM with React/Next.js Versions [P1] [DEP]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P1  
**Category:** DEP (Dependency Health)

**Description:**  
`react-dom` is on 19.x while `react` and `next` are pinned to 18/14, which can introduce runtime mismatches. Align the React DOM version with the supported React major for Next.js 14.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `react` and `react-dom` use the same supported major version for Next.js 14 (18.x).
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are updated accordingly.
- `npm run build` (or equivalent build validation) completes without React version warnings.

**References:**
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

## P2 - Medium (Hardening, Polish, Documentation)
### T-051: Remove Unused MDX Loader Dependencies [P2] [DEP]
**Type:** DEADCODE  
**Priority:** P2  
**Category:** DEP (Dependency Health)

**Description:**  
`@mdx-js/loader` and `@mdx-js/react` are listed as dependencies but are not referenced in the app or configuration. Validate they are not required for the current Next.js MDX setup and remove them if unused.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Confirm no imports/usages of `@mdx-js/loader` or `@mdx-js/react` in the codebase or build configuration.
- Remove unused packages from `package.json` and `package-lock.json` if safe.
- `npm run build` completes without MDX-related errors after removal.

**References:**
- `package.json`
- `next.config.mjs`
- `components/BlogPostContent.tsx`
