Document Type: Workflow
Last Updated: 2026-01-07
Task Truth Source: **TODO.md**

This file is the single source of truth for actionable work. If another document disagrees, the task record in this file wins (unless the Constitution overrides).

## Goals (from chat)
- Site: High-performance marketing site for “Your Dedicated Marketer”
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (GitHub integration)
- Standard: Diamond Standard (performance, accessibility, observability, testing)
- Keep: Sentry, PWA, Search
- Contact flow: Store lead in Supabase (server-only) + sync to HubSpot CRM
	- No email sending
	- Save suspicious submissions but flag them (suspicious = too many requests)
	- Required fields: Name, Email, Phone
	- UX: Return success even if HubSpot sync fails (best-effort)

## Task Schema (Required)
- **ID**: `T-###` (unique, sequential)
- **Priority**: `P0 | P1 | P2 | P3`
- **Type**: `SECURITY | RELEASE | DEPENDENCY | DOCS | QUALITY | BUG | FEATURE | CHORE`
- **Owner**: `AGENT | Trevor`
- **Status**: `READY | BLOCKED | IN-PROGRESS | IN-REVIEW | DONE`
- **Context**: why the task exists (1–5 bullets)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: verifiable checklist (broken into subtasks T-###.#)
- **References**: file paths and/or links inside this repo
- **Dependencies**: task IDs (if any)
- **Effort**: `XS | S | M | L | XL` (XS = < 30 min, S = < 2 hr, M = < 4 hr, L = < 1 day, XL = > 1 day)

### Priority Meaning
- **P0**: BLOCKS BUILD or causes security/data loss — fix immediately
- **P1**: High impact; do within 7 days
- **P2**: Important but not urgent; do within 30 days
- **P3**: Backlog/tech debt; do when convenient

### Ownership Rule
- **Owner: AGENT** — task can be executed by Codex/Claude Code/Copilot in-repo
- **Owner: Trevor** — requires external actions (provider dashboards, DNS, billing, approvals)
