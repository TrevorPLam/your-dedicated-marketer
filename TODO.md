## P0 - Critical (Correctness, Security, Blockers)

## P1 - High (Reliability, Core UX, Maintainability)

## P2 - Medium (Hardening, Polish, Documentation)

### T-030: Regenerate package-lock.json for @next/mdx Alignment [P2] [QUALITY]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P2  
**Category:** DEP (Dependency Health)  
**Effort:** S

**Context:**  
Registry access was blocked during the @next/mdx alignment, so the lockfile needs regeneration in an environment with npm registry access to restore the correct integrity metadata.
Current environment cannot reach the npm registry (`ENETUNREACH` even with proxy vars cleared); rerun where registry access is permitted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Run `npm install --package-lock-only` in an environment with registry access
- [ ] Ensure @next/mdx resolves to 14.2.18 with valid integrity data
- [ ] Confirm no other dependency drift is introduced
- [ ] Status note added if blocked due to registry access

**Status:** Blocked in this environment (2026-01-05). Registry calls return `ENETUNREACH`. This occurred even after clearing HTTP(S)_PROXY/NO_PROXY via env overrides and forcing the registry during `npm install --package-lock-only` and `npm ping`. Retry when outbound access is available; run `npm run check:npm-registry` first.

**References:**
- File: `package-lock.json`

**Dependencies:** None

### T-031: Add Vitest Coverage Dependency [P2] [QUALITY]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P2  
**Category:** DX (Developer Experience)  
**Effort:** S

**Context:**  
Running `npm run test:coverage` prompts for `@vitest/coverage-v8`, indicating the coverage provider is missing.
Current environment cannot reach the npm registry (`ENETUNREACH` even with proxy vars cleared); add the dependency and regenerate the lockfile where registry access is permitted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a dev dependency
- [ ] Update `package-lock.json` with registry-backed integrity data
- [ ] Verify `npm run test:coverage` runs without prompting
- [ ] Status note added if blocked due to registry access

**Status:** Blocked in this environment (2026-01-05). Registry access fails with `ENETUNREACH`. This occurred even after clearing HTTP(S)_PROXY/NO_PROXY via env overrides and forcing the registry during `npm install --package-lock-only` and `npm ping`. Retry once outbound connectivity is restored; confirm with `npm run check:npm-registry`.

**References:**
- File: `package.json`
- Config: `vitest.config.ts`

**Dependencies:** None
