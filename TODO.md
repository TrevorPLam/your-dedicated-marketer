### T-050: Align React DOM with React/Next.js Versions
**Priority:** P1
**Type:** QUALITY
**Description:**  
`react-dom` and `@types/react-dom` are on 19.x while `react` and `@types/react` are on 18.x, which can introduce runtime and type-checking mismatches. Align the React DOM version and its types with the supported React major for Next.js 14.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, and `@types/react-dom` use the same supported major version for Next.js 14 (18.x).
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are updated accordingly.
- `npm run build` (or equivalent build validation) completes without React version warnings or type errors.
- `package-lock.json`
**Dependencies:** None
**Effort:** S

## P2 - Medium (Hardening, Polish, Documentation)

### T-051: Remove Unused MDX Loader Dependencies
**Priority:** P2
**Type:** DEADCODE
**Context:** `@mdx-js/loader` and `@mdx-js/react` are listed as dependencies but are not referenced in the codebase or Next.js configuration, increasing install surface area.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Confirm no imports/usages of `@mdx-js/loader` or `@mdx-js/react` in app code or build configuration.
- Remove unused packages from `package.json` and `package-lock.json` if safe.
- `npm run build` completes without MDX-related errors after removal.
**References:**
- `package.json`
- `next.config.mjs`
- `components/BlogPostContent.tsx`
**Dependencies:** None
**Effort:** S
