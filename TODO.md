## P0 - Critical (Correctness, Security, Blockers)

### T-029: Complete Manual Smoke Tests in Preview Deployment [P0] [QUALITY]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P0  
**Category:** REL (Release Gate)  
**Effort:** S

**Context:**  
Release 2026.01.05 smoke tests could not fully complete in the local environment due to Playwright/browser instability and font fetch errors. Manual smoke verification is required in a stable Preview Deployment or live environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Verify Universal UI tests in Preview Deployment (app loads, nav works, happy path completes, error state triggers, mobile layout usable)
- [ ] Verify contact form validation errors surface correctly when submitting invalid inputs
- [ ] Record results in the next Release Record

**References:**
- Doc: `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`

**Dependencies:** None

## P1 - High (Reliability, Core UX, Maintainability)

## P2 - Medium (Hardening, Polish, Documentation)

### T-030: Regenerate package-lock.json for @next/mdx Alignment [P2] [QUALITY]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P2  
**Category:** DEP (Dependency Health)  
**Effort:** S

**Context:**  
Registry access was blocked during the @next/mdx alignment, so the lockfile needs regeneration in an environment with npm registry access to restore the correct integrity metadata.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Run `npm install --package-lock-only` in an environment with registry access
- [ ] Ensure @next/mdx resolves to 14.2.18 with valid integrity data
- [ ] Confirm no other dependency drift is introduced

**References:**
- File: `package-lock.json`

**Dependencies:** None

### T-031: Add Vitest Coverage Dependency [P2] [QUALITY]
**Type:** QUALITY  
**Priority:** P2  
**Category:** DX (Developer Experience)  
**Effort:** S

**Context:**  
Running `npm run test:coverage` prompts for `@vitest/coverage-v8`, indicating the coverage provider is missing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a dev dependency
- [ ] Update `package-lock.json` with registry-backed integrity data
- [ ] Verify `npm run test:coverage` runs without prompting

**References:**
- File: `package.json`
- Config: `vitest.config.ts`

**Dependencies:** None
