## ADR-003: Use Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-26

### Context
Need efficient, maintainable styling solution for marketing site with responsive design.

### Decision
Use Tailwind CSS with custom configuration.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **CSS Modules**: More verbose, harder to maintain consistency
2. **Styled Components**: Runtime overhead, larger bundle size
3. **Vanilla CSS**: Too much manual work for responsive design

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Small production bundle (unused classes purged)
- Consistent design system
- Excellent responsive design utilities
- No runtime overhead

#### Negative
- HTML can look cluttered with many classes
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with utility-first CSS
- Requires build step for optimization

### Implementation Notes
Use custom theme extending Tailwind defaults for brand colors and spacing.

## ADR-004: Use Dual MDX Approach for Content

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-03 (Documented)

### Context
The site needs to process MDX content in two different ways:
1. Static MDX pages that are part of the app structure (compiled at build time)
2. Dynamic blog content stored in `/content` directory (processed at runtime)

### Decision
Use both @next/mdx and next-mdx-remote in parallel for their respective use cases.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Only @next/mdx**: Would require all content to be in app directory, limiting content management flexibility
2. **Only next-mdx-remote**: Would work but less performant for static pages that could be compiled at build time
3. **Custom MDX processing**: More control but requires significant maintenance overhead

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Optimal performance: build-time compilation for static pages
- Content flexibility: runtime processing for dynamic blog posts
- Best of both worlds: each tool used for its strengths
- Standard tooling: both are official/well-maintained solutions

#### Negative
- Two MDX dependencies to maintain
- Slightly larger bundle size
- Need to remember which approach to use for different content types

### Implementation Notes
- @next/mdx configured in next.config.mjs for app-level MDX files
- next-mdx-remote used in blog/[slug]/page.tsx for dynamic content
- Both share the same rehype/remark plugins for consistency

## ADR-005: Use clsx + tailwind-merge Utility Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-03 (Documented)

### Context
Need utility for managing conditional CSS classes and handling Tailwind CSS class conflicts.

### Decision
Implement `cn()` utility function combining clsx and tailwind-merge.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Only clsx**: Handles conditionals but doesn't resolve Tailwind conflicts
2. **Only tailwind-merge**: Resolves conflicts but less elegant conditional syntax
3. **Custom implementation**: Reinventing the wheel

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Clean conditional class syntax from clsx
- Automatic Tailwind class conflict resolution from tailwind-merge
- Industry-standard pattern used across many projects
- Small bundle size for both libraries

#### Negative
- Two dependencies instead of one
- Developers need to understand both libraries

### Implementation Notes
Defined in lib/utils.ts as `cn()` helper function. Used throughout components for className management.

## ADR-006: CSRF Protection via Next.js Server Actions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-03

### Context
Contact form and future forms need CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent unauthorized form submissions from malicious sites. Traditional approaches use explicit CSRF tokens, but Next.js Server Actions provide built-in protection.

### Decision
Rely on Next.js Server Actions built-in CSRF protection instead of implementing explicit token validation.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Explicit CSRF tokens (double-submit cookie)**: More complex, requires token generation/validation, state management
2. **CSRF middleware library**: Additional dependency, not needed with Server Actions
3. **Custom token implementation**: Reinventing framework capabilities

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Zero implementation effort - built into Next.js
- Framework automatically validates Origin/Referer headers
- No token state to manage
- Works seamlessly with Server Actions pattern
- Reduces attack surface (no token to leak)

#### Negative
- Less explicit/visible than token-based approaches
- Depends on framework implementation (vendor lock-in)
- May need explicit tokens if adding traditional API routes
- Some security auditors may prefer visible token validation

### Implementation Notes
- Contact form uses Server Actions in `lib/actions.ts`
- Next.js validates Origin header on all POST requests to Server Actions
- SameSite cookie policy (Lax) provides additional protection
- Security headers enforced via `middleware.ts`

### Future Considerations
If we add traditional API routes (not Server Actions), we should:
1. Implement explicit CSRF tokens for those endpoints
2. Consider using a library like `csrf-csrf` or `edge-csrf`
3. Document the dual approach (Server Actions vs API routes)

**References:**
- Implementation: `lib/actions.ts`
- Security headers: `middleware.ts`
- Documentation: `SECURITY.md` (CSRF Protection section)

## ADR-007: In-Memory Rate Limiting for MVP

**Status**: Accepted (with planned migration)  
**Date**: 2026-01-03

### Context
Contact form needs rate limiting to prevent spam and abuse. Options include in-memory, database-backed, or third-party services. For MVP launch with low traffic, need simple solution that can scale later.

### Decision
Implement in-memory rate limiting for MVP, with documented migration path to persistent storage for production.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Upstash Redis**: Excellent for serverless, but adds cost and complexity for MVP
2. **Vercel KV**: Great edge support, but requires Vercel deployment
3. **Arcjet**: Purpose-built rate limiting, but adds monthly cost
4. **Database-backed**: Requires database queries for every form submission
5. **No rate limiting**: Leaves form vulnerable to spam and abuse

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Simple implementation: native JavaScript Map
- No external dependencies
- Zero cost
- No database queries
- Fast lookups (O(1))
- Sufficient for MVP with single instance
- Easy to test locally

#### Negative
- ⚠️ **Does not persist across restarts** (acceptable for MVP)
- ⚠️ **Does not work across multiple instances** (serverless problem)
- ⚠️ **Memory usage grows unbounded** without cleanup
- Only limits by email, not by IP
- Can be bypassed by using different email addresses

### Implementation Notes

Current implementation:
```typescript
// lib/actions.ts
const rateLimitMap = new Map<string, { count: number; resetAt: number }>()
// Limit: 3 submissions per hour per email
```

Cleanup strategy:
- Expired entries removed on next access
- Map remains in memory (acceptable for low traffic)

### Migration Path

For production at scale (tracked in T-016):

**Phase 1: Choose Solution**
- **Upstash Redis**: Best for serverless/edge
- **Vercel KV**: If deploying to Vercel
- **Arcjet**: If need advanced bot protection

**Phase 2: Implementation**
1. Install chosen rate limiting SDK
2. Update `lib/actions.ts` to use external service
3. Add environment variables for service credentials
4. Add IP-based rate limiting (in addition to email)
5. Test across multiple instances

**Phase 3: Monitoring**
- Track rate limit hits
- Alert on suspicious patterns
- Adjust limits based on legitimate traffic

### Acceptance Criteria for Production

Before high-traffic launch, rate limiting must:
- [ ] Persist across server restarts
- [ ] Work across multiple serverless instances
- [ ] Include IP-based limiting
- [ ] Have monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Be documented in deployment docs

**References:**
- Implementation: `lib/actions.ts` lines 21-48
- Documentation: `SECURITY.md` (Rate Limiting section)
- Migration task: `TODO.md` - T-016
- Production planning: `TODO.md` - T-007

## ADR-008: Remove Deprecated next-pwa Package

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-03

### Context
The project was using `next-pwa@5.6.0` to automatically generate service workers for Progressive Web App functionality. However, next-pwa is no longer actively maintained (last update 2022) and may have compatibility issues with Next.js 14.

The project has PWA features including:
- Web app manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- PWA icons (192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon)
- Custom install prompt component (`components/InstallPrompt.tsx`)

Need to decide: migrate to maintained fork, implement custom service worker, or remove automated service worker generation.

### Decision
Remove next-pwa package while keeping basic PWA features (manifest, icons, install prompt).

**Rationale:**
1. Marketing site doesn't require offline functionality
2. Service worker caching adds complexity and potential bugs
3. Manifest and install prompt work without next-pwa
4. Reduces bundle size and build complexity
5. Removes dependency on unmaintained package

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Migrate to @ducanh2912/next-pwa (maintained fork)**
   - Pros: Keeps service worker, actively maintained
   - Cons: Adds dependency, complexity, and we don't need offline caching

2. **Custom service worker implementation**
   - Pros: Full control
   - Cons: Maintenance burden, potential bugs, not needed for our use case

3. **Remove all PWA features**
   - Pros: Simplest approach
   - Cons: Loses ability to install as app, which some users may want

### Consequences

#### Positive
- ✅ No unmaintained dependencies
- ✅ Simpler build configuration
- ✅ Reduced bundle size
- ✅ Less complexity in caching strategy
- ✅ Faster builds (no service worker generation)
- ✅ Keep install-to-home-screen functionality

#### Negative
- ❌ No offline functionality (acceptable for marketing site)
- ❌ No automatic caching of assets (CDN handles this)
- ❌ No background sync (not needed)

### Implementation Notes

**Removed:**
- `next-pwa` package from devDependencies
- `withPWA()` wrapper from next.config.mjs
- Service worker configuration (runtime caching rules)

**Kept:**
- `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest
- PWA icons (icon-192.png, icon-512.png, apple-touch-icon.png)
- `components/InstallPrompt.tsx` - Custom install prompt
- Manifest link in app/layout.tsx

**What Still Works:**
- Users can install the app to their home screen
- App appears in standalone mode when launched from home screen
- Custom branding and shortcuts defined in manifest
- Install prompt appears on supported browsers

### Future Considerations

If offline functionality becomes important:
1. Evaluate @ducanh2912/next-pwa (maintained fork)
2. Consider Workbox for more control
3. Implement incremental caching for specific routes only

For now, the basic installable PWA is sufficient for our marketing use case.

**References:**
- Removed package: `next-pwa@5.6.0`
- Config: `next.config.mjs`
- Manifest: `public/manifest.json`
- Install prompt: `components/InstallPrompt.tsx`
- PWA icons guide: `docs/PWA-ICONS.md`
